Life 
==== 
 
[Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) implementation in terminal written in Python.
 
Currently Life only works on *nix based systems because it determines the terminals' rows and columns count using the 'stty size' external command. 
 
Life should work on Python 2.7.4, as it is being developed on it. Python 3.* would break it.
